///
/// Objective ordering between nodes is important in case of lots disputes, so nodes will pull in
/// the same direction and work on resolving the same disputes first. This ensures that we will
/// conclude some disputes, even if there are lots of them. While any objective ordering would
/// suffice for this goal, ordering by age ensures we are not only resolving disputes, but also
/// resolve the oldest one first, which are also the most urgent and important ones to resolve.
///
/// Note: That by `oldest` we mean oldest in terms of relay chain block number, for any block
/// number that has not yet been finalized. If a block has been finalized already it should be
/// treated as low priority when it comes to disputes, as even in the case of a negative outcome,
/// we are already too late. The ordering mechanism here serves to prevent this from happening in
/// the first place.
